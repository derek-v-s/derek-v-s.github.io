    <h1>Fundamental Human Motivations</h1>
</header>

<section>

    <p>This list represents broad categories of fundamental drives shaping human behavior at a high level of abstraction:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Survival:</strong> The core biological imperative for safety, sustenance, health, and continuation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Connection:</strong> The need to bond, belong, love, and feel part of a community.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Agency:</strong> The drive for control, autonomy, competence, and self-determination.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Understanding:</strong> The motivation to make sense of experiences, find meaning, and reduce uncertainty.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Growth:</strong> The impulse to develop, learn, improve, and transcend limitations.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Contribution:</strong> The drive to help others, make a positive impact, and be part of something larger than oneself.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Adherence to Belief Systems:</strong> The drive to align actions with deeply held beliefs, values, or worldviews.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Experience / Well-being:</strong> The drive to seek positive subjective states (pleasure, joy, comfort, excitement, novelty) and avoid negative ones (pain, distress, boredom).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <em>Note: These motivations are interconnected and often influence behavior simultaneously. Furthermore, the principle of energy conservation/effort minimization acts as a fundamental modulating factor, influencing how efficiently these drives are pursued, particularly in relation to Survival and Well-being.</em>
